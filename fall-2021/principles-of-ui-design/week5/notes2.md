### Predictive Evaluation
- It uses human cognition to predict usability
- The engineering model is:
	* abstract
	* quantitative
	* approximate
	* estimated from user experiments

#### Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)
- It defines several opeations
	* Keystroke: ~0.28s
	* Button press/release: ~0.1s 
	* Pointing: ~1.1s
	* Draw line: use STEERING LAW
	* Home hands between mouse and keyboard: ~0.4s
	* Mentally prepare: ~1.2s

#### Mental Preparetion Time
- Before each task or subtask
- Deciding which way to do a task
- Retrieving a chunk from memory
- Finding something on screen  
**Note:** Heuristically decide where to put *M* 
**Note:** KLM ignores parallel action like thinking about password while homing keyboard to mouse. Use *CPM-GOMS* to get more precise calculation.

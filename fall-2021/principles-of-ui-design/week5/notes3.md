### Errors & User Control

#### Human Erros
- Slips(failing execution) and lapses(failure of memory) 
- Mistakes: Using wrong procedure for the goal

##### Slips
- **Capture**: User does things that he/she used to do and it causes errors
	* Leave your house and find yourself walking to school
	* vi ':w' commmand vs ':wq' command

- **Description:** Throwing shirt into oiler instead of hamper

##### Lapses 
- Loss of intention
	* Walking another room and forgetting why you went therej
- Omission due to interruption	
	* Getting coat to go out, then interrupted by a phone call and then go out wihtout your coat
- Omissions due to already-satisfied goal
	- Waking away from an ATM without your card. That happens because the real reason to visit ATM is getting cash and if ATM gives card after we get the cash.  

#### Mode Errors

	* Eliminate modes 
	* Increase visibility of mode

#### Efficiency

##### Implification of Fitts's Law
- Target at screen edge are easy to hit
- It is easy to hover objects on the edge of the screen

#### Steering Task
- T = a + b D/S
	* D -> length of tunnel
	* S -> width of tunnel  
**Example:**Drawing Line in MS Paint
- In general, it is **linear** operation
- It is slower than pointing task(**logarithmic**)

#### Improve Mouse Efficiency
- Make frequently-used targets big
- Put related targets together
- Use screen corners and edges
- Avoid steering task


#### Improve Efficiency In General
- Use keyboard shortcuts 
- Save history and use autocompletion

### Efficiency
- It is defined as number of operation that user does within UI, it is not about algorithm efficiency.

#### Human Information Processing
- Perception Cycle:  
Sense -> Short Term Store -> Perception Proccessor -> Cognitive Processor -> Motor Processor -> Feedback
- Times that spends in: 
	* Perception: ~100ms [50-200 ms]
	* Cognitive:  ~ 70ms [30-100 ms]
	* Motor:      ~ 70ms [25-170 ms]

##### Perceptual Fusion
- Give feedback events that occour up to 100ms

##### Cognitive Processor
1. Rule-based: **if X, then do Y**
2. Skill-based: learned throughly from practice
3. Knowledge-based: higher-level thinking and problem-solving

##### Motor Processing
- Open-loop Control
	* No input needed
	* ~70 ms
- Closed-loop Control
	* Input needed
	* Takes full processing cycle: Tc + Tc + Tm ~240 ms

#### Fitt's Law
- It is a theory to move your hand to target
- T = RT + MT = a + b(log(D/S + 1)
	* D -> Distance
	* S -> Size of Object
- These theory can be use to estimate mouse hovering operation.

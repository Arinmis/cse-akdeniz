### Iterative Design
- Iterative approach
while *not satisfied*:
Design -> Implement -> Evaluate
- Traditional approach - Waterfall Model
* Requirements -> Design -> Code -> Integration -> Acceptance -> Release

- Waterfall model is bad for UI Design
* UI flaws often cause changes in requirements and design
- Iterative design is the wrong way
* If users doesn't like software, they may buy another one and your work doesn't have another change to improve.
#### Spiral Model
- Evaluate after couple of *design-implement* cycle
while *not satisfied*:
while *it good enough*:
Design -> Implement
-> Evaluate
#### Design
* Task & User analysis
* Design principles
#### Implementation
* Prototyping
* GUI implementation
#### Evaluation
* Put prototypes to the test
* Expert, predictive or empirical evaluation

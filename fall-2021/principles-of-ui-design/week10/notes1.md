### Output
- Tree Output Approaches:
	1. Object
		- Views, Interactors, widget
	2. Stokes
		- vector graphics
		- No quality loss 
	3. Pixels
		- raster, bitmap, 
- Object -> drawing -> Strokes -> rasterization -> Pixels
 - In overlapping, just redraw effected nodes of view tree.    
 - Naive approach causes flash effect.

#### Objects to Strokes
#### Stoke Model
- Drawing primitives like curves and lines.
### Pixel Approach
- Rectangular array of pixels

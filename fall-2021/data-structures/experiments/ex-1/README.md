### Measure String Concatenation Time
This Experiment is about measuring string concatenation time in various languages.   
#### Algorithm of n Times concatenation
    temp := "" 
    i := 1
    while n >= i 
      temp := temp + "c"
      i = i + 1

#### Concatenation Times 
In each language concatenation will be performed n = 1e3, n = 1e4, , n = 1e5, n = 1e6 times. Measurement will be in millisecond.  

#### Languages 
1. C
2. C++
3. Java
4. C#

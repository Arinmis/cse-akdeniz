# Historical Background
- Babylonians invented the **abacus**
    * First mechanical calculator
- **Blase Pascal** constructed gears and wheels.
- Charles Babbage with Augusta Ada Byron created **Analytical Engine**.
    * Steam-powered mechanical computer
    * Used puched cards

- Alan Turing developed **Colossus** to broke German secret codes generated by ENIGMA.
    * Used vacuum tubes
    * Not programmable
- **ENIAC** developed by University of Pennsylvania.
    * Vacuum tubes are used.
    * First programmable machine 

# Programming Advancements
- Programmable machines created programming languages.
- The first, **machine language** constructed. 
    * More efficient than rewiring a machine.
- **von Neumann** developed system that accept instructions and store them in memory.
- **Assembly language** is invented to simplify entering binary code.  
    * Code with **mnemonic**. Instead of ```ADD``, use ```0100 0111```.
- Other high-level languages rised: BASIC, PASCAL, C/C++, C#, Java, and ADA.


# Reminder
- **Bit**: zero or one
- 4 bit called **nibble**.
- 8 bit called **byte**.
- 2 byte called **word**.
- 1 KB = 1024 Byte = 2 ** 10 byte.
- 1 MB = 1024 KB = 2 ** 20 byte.
- 1 GB = 1024 GB= 2 ** 30 byte.


# The Microprocessor Age
- World's first microprocessor the **Intel 4004**. 
- 1978, Intel 8086 and 8088 rised:
    * 16-bit microprocessors
    * 400 ns per instruction
    * 2.5 million instructions per second.
    * addressed 1M memory location.
    * Called **CISC**.


# Some definitions
- **Integrated Circuit:** Miniaturized electronic circuit.
- **Micorprocessor:** CPU on a single integrated circuit.
- Micorcomputer and Microcontroller
    * **Micorcomputer:** uses microprocessor as its CPU.
    * **Microcontroller:** computer-on-a-chip, it has elements like ROM, RAM, peripherals.


# Memory and I/O System
- Bus connects blocks.

Main memory divided into 3 parts:
- TPA (transient program area)
- System area
- XMS(extended memory system)

## TPA
The transient program area (TPA) holds the DOS(disk operating system.
- TPA is a DOS concept.

## The System Area
Smaller than system area. Contains RAM and ROM.

## Windows Systems 
## I/O Space
I/O devices allow the microprocessor to communicate with the outside world. 

I/O space in a computer system extends I/O port 0000H to port FFFFH.
- **I/O port address** is similar to a memory address.

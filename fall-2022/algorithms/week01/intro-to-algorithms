# Algorithm

A sequence of computational steps that transform the input to the desired output.

- An algorightm must be halt.

- Algorithms must be:
    * fast
    * use little memory
    * correct

- Two things affect the running times: 
    - input size.
    - state / position of the input.
        * worst, avarage or best case depends on it.
## Sorting problem

### Insertion sort
- make sorted proviously iterated part.

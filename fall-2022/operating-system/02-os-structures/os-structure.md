# Operating-System Structure
Modular approach is preffered rather than monolithic approach.


## Simple Structure
## Layered Approach
System can be modular in many ways. One way to do this is __layered approach__. Too many layer might cause performance problems. 
## Microkernels 
It is created with removing all none-essantial components from the kernel and implementing them as system and user-level programs.
## Modules
## Hybrid Systems
Linux and Solaris are monolithic because single address space provides very efficient performance.
### Mac OS X
### iOS
### Android

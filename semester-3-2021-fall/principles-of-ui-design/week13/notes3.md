### Color desing and typography 
- Red-green color blindness
    * Use redundant signal
        - brightness, location and shape 

### Chromatic Aberration
    - Different wavelenghts focus differently
        * Highly sperated wavelenghts(red and bule) can't be focused simultaneously.

### Color Guidelines
- Avoid saturated colors
- Use few colors
- Be consistent with expectations

### Summary
- Be simple.

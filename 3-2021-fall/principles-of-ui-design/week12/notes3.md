### Contrast & Visual Variables
- value -> intensity
- hue -> color
- texture 
- shape
- position
- orientation
- size

1. Scale
    - All of them nominal
    - All of them ordered except {orientation, hue, size} 
    - Just two of them quantitative: position and size

2. **Length = number of distinguishable levels, consider all variable**

#### Techniques for Contrast
- Choose appropriate visual var.
- Use as much length as possible
- Use the 'squint test'

#### Gestalt Principle of Grouping
- Proximity
- Similarity
- Continuity
- Closure
- Area
- Symmetry

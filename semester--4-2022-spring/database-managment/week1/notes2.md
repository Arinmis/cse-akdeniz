### File-Based Approach
- It hard to manipulate data stored in file.
    * Entire read and write needed
- Each program defines and manages its own data(kinda race condition)
#### Limitations
- Seperations and isolation of data
- Duplication of data
- Data dependence
    * Program needs to be update after changes


### Database Approach
- SQL
    * DDL -> define structure
    * DML -> maniputale data 

#### Views
- Predefined set of data that only required persons read/write them.
- It allows security


#### Cons. of DBMS
- Cost
- Complexity
- Higher impact of a failure

### Computer Components
- Von Neumann architecture based on:
    * Data and instructions are stored in disk.
    * Contents of locations can be addressable.
    * Execuation occurs in a **squencial fashion**


- Programming in hardware 

```
Data -> arithmetic and logic function -> Result
```

- Programming in software
```
Instruction codes -> [Instruction interpreter]
                                 ↓
                           Control Signals
                                 ↓
Data -> [General Purpose arithmetic and logic function] -> Result
```

#### Major Components 
1. CPU
    * Instruction interpreter
    * General-purpose arithmetic and logict func. 
2. I/O
3. Memory
4. Bus

#### Basic Instruction Cycle
1. Fetch
    - *Program Counter* holds address of instruction to be executed.
    - Instructions fetched to IR.

**Note:** Intruction set defines CPU types. 16 bit CPU for 16 bit word

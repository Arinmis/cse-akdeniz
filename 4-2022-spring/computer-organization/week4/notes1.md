# Memory System

## Locations

1. Internal

    - Processor register
    - Cache
    - Main memory

2. External
    - Optical disk
    - Magnetic Disk

## Capacity

1. Words
2. Bytes

## Unit of Transfer

1. Word
2. Block

## Access Method

1. Sequenctial
    - CD, DVD and tapes
    - It is cheap
2. Direct
    - Shared read/write access
    - Read/write takes _different_ amount of time.
3. Random
    - Read/write takes _same_ amount of time.
4. Associative
    - You can compute the address not, access it.

## Performance Time

-   Access time
-   Cycle time: depends on CPU clock cycle
-   Transfer rate

### Caches

-   L1 -> in CPU
    -   I cash -> Instruction cash
    -   D cash -> data cash
-   L2, L3 -> Those are bigger than L1
    -   Operations needs more cycles

# Process Scheduling
Multiprogramming is about running some process all the time, to maximize CPU utilization. The objective of time sharing is to switch the CPU among processes so frequently that users can interact with each program while it is running.  
On a single-processor system, there will never be  more than one running process.


## Scheduling Queues
As processes enter the system, they are put into a __job queue__, which consists of all processes in the system. Waiting to be executed processed are in ready queue.

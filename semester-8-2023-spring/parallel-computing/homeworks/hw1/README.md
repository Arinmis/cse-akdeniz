## Problem

Efficiency in matrix multiplication is crucial for applications in various computational fields. Traditional algorithms may not utilize modern hardware efficiently, leading to performance bottlenecks.

## Your Solution Strategy

We compared a traditional matrix multiplication method with an optimized, transpose-based approach, analyzing the impact of compiler optimizations (`-O3` flag) on both.

## Data Visualizations

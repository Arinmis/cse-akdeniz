### 1.3 Integrated Circuit
- microprocessor  -> CPU
- microcontroller -> it is a tiny computer 
- Moore's law: number of transsistor doubles every two year 

### CPU Families
- Similar or identical instruction set
- Similar or identical OS
- Speed
- I/O ports
- Memroy size
- Cost

### Intel x86 Architecture
- CISC: Complex Instruction Set Computer
    * Complex/robust instructions 
    * Much more higher level instructions are supported
    * Takes severeal clock cycle to execute
- RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer
    * Simple/primitive instructions set
    * Fast decode and execution
    * Dedicated for speacial purpose

- ARM: Advanced RISC Machines
- **Note:** 1.6GHz CPU does't have to be faster than 2.0GHz CPU. It's just indicate frequency of clock cycle not number of operation that is performed by CPU.


#### Embedded Systems
- Tightly coupled to their enviroment
- Electronics and software within a product 

#### IoT

## History of Computers
### First generation: Vacuum-tube
- ENIAC
    * Decimal computer
#### John von Neumann
- He founded stored program concepts
- Von Neumann architeture is still using.(IAS computer) 
- IAS memory consist of 40 bit
    * To store number: 1 bit for sign, 39 for value
    * To store instruction: Two 20 bit used 
        + 8 bit for opcode(operation code)
        + 12 bit for address
    * **Word**: ordered set of bytes, x bit CPU has x bit word.
    * I/O <-> Arithmetic-logic, Program control unit <-> Main memory
        + Program counter: decides which expression will be executedo

#### Registers
- One of the instructions parameter must be register
- Main memory is much more slow than CPU.
    * Fetching data from memory takes up to 300-400 ns
    * Machine cycle: fetch -> decode -> execute


### Second generation: Transistors 
### Second generation: Integrated Circuit

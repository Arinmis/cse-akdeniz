    * forwarding

#### Circuit Switching
    - Dedicated resources: no sharing
    - Guaranteed performance
    - FDM & TDM

#### Packet vs. Curcuit Switching
    - Packet Switching Pros:
        * resource sharing
        * simpler, no call setup
    - Packet Switching Cons:
        * congestion might be happen

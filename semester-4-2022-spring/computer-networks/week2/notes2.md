### Wireless Link Characteristic

-   decresed signal strength
-   interference from other sources
-   multipath propagation
-   _Hidden Terminal Problem:_
    -   B, A hear each other
    -   B, C hear each other
    -   A, C connot hear each other, so they are unawareof their interference at B.
-   _Exposed terminal problem:_
    -   Unnecessary waiting for communication.

### IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (Wi-Fi)

-   It is a link layer protocol
-   Sense before transmitting.
-   802.11: no collision detection

### 802.15: Personal Area Network

-   Less than 10 m diameter.
-   ad hoc: no infrastructure
-   master/slave relationsship
-   802.15 evolved from Bluetooth

#### Mobility

-   Changes in physical layer doesn't effect other higher level protocols.
